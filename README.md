# Exploratory Data Analysis of Anime Dataset (MyAnimeList 2023)

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large anime
dataset sourced from MyAnimeList (2023 snapshot). The objective is to uncover
patterns in ratings, popularity, content type, and genre distribution, and
to translate raw data into clear, interpretable insights.

The project emphasizes analytical thinking, visualization, and insight
storytelling rather than predictive modeling.

## Problem Statement
User ratings and popularity in entertainment platforms are influenced by
multiple factors such as content type, release format, and audience behavior.
Understanding these patterns helps platforms and content producers answer
questions such as:
- What types of anime receive higher ratings?
- How do popularity and ratings relate?
- Are certain genres or formats consistently favored?

This project explores these questions through data-driven analysis.

## Data
The dataset contains metadata for thousands of anime titles, including:
- Title information
- Genre and type (TV, Movie, OVA, etc.)
- User scores and rating counts
- Popularity indicators

**Data Usage Note**  
This project uses a publicly available anime dataset collected for analytical
purposes. Only processed data and analysis outputs are shown in this repository.
